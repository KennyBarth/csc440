Kenneth Barth - Registration/password update code skeleton by directory



wiki/web/routes.py:
    @bp.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
        def register()
            //No arguments, this route renders the page for the user to register a new account
    @bp.route('/changepassword', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
        def change(User)
            //Accepts a User object as an argument to update its password which is contained in the data attribute.

wiki/web/forms.py:
    class RegisterForm(extends FlaskForm)
        //RegisterForm will keep the validation features of LoginForm, which I will change to be an interface
        //In addition to the methods currently associated with LoginForm, RegisterForm has fields for current and new passwords
wiki/web/templates:
    register.html(url, form, page)
        //Jinja template that renders the page for users to register their account
    changePassword.html(url, form, page)
        //Jinja template that renders the page for users to change their password

wiki/web/user.py:
    //nothing in this file will need to be changed but it should be noted that the registration feature will use the User.add_user() method, and the password change feature will use the User.update(), both of which call the UserManager.write() API to add the user to the JSON file.
